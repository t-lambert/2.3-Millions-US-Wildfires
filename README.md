# 2.3-Millions-US-Wildfires
Personal project on wildfires in US between 1992 and 2020

Hello! Welcome on this repository in which you will found several notebooks dedicated to a small project I have done on wildfires occurring in the US between 1992 and 2020. You will found my own analysis, from data import and cleaning, some interactives maps, data visualization and obviously some machine learning to predict the cause of a wildfire, at the US and California scales. Enjoy!

Note that interactives maps and figures from Plotly are not supported by Github repositories. Therefore, I 'pushed' them as 'png', but you can find full interactives maps and figures on my Kaggle notebooks:

1 - Import and cleaning: https://www.kaggle.com/code/lamberttibo/2-3m-wildfires-1-import-and-clean

2 - Interactive maps: https://www.kaggle.com/code/lamberttibo/2-3m-wildfires-2-maps

3 - Data Viz': https://www.kaggle.com/code/lamberttibo/2-3m-wildfires-3-data-viz

4 - Machine Learning : https://www.kaggle.com/code/lamberttibo/2-3m-wildfires-4-predictions


As a recent dev' on Python, any suggestion to optimize the code is welcome.
